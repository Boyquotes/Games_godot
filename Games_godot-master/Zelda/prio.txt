1. code refactoring -> modular templates for future projects (?)
2. game loop decisions 
	2.1 	- resistance system that allows to stack resistances to be able to proceed to next level and be able to defeat the boss
		- mobs do the damage type of the biome so you have to prepare before proceeding to next level
		- make something else that makes it important to get specific gear
