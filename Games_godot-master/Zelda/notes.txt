NOTES 27/04/22
	- dropped pwrups are not taken from the DB -> cannot be put in inv with current system -> make (wand) pwrups drop as items from a DB (?)

NOTES 04/05/22
	- implement rest of wand proj's
	- next step should be enemy resistances to test the diff weapons on (what happens when weap is dmg type but uses ailments -> mode dam?)
	- implement some kind of monster spawner that can be triggered in every lvl
	- start implementing better architecture -> decoupling

NOTES 07/05.22
	- make lazor animations
	- lazor coll
	- lazor behaviour -> slowly dissapearing starting from player pos (anim?)

NOTES 17/05/22
	- burn does not work on wand_proj ||-||
	- dropped items get removed even if they've been picked up

NOTES 18/05/22
	- dropped item remove timer cannot start multiple times which is why not all items are removed from the dropped_items array -> fixed
	- reformat coll/drop stuff

NOTES 21/05/22
	- encountered weird movement bug when pushed against the wall from snow enemies ||-||
	- enemy scaling seems weak
	- poison enemies are stronge
	- player modifiers after boss kill would enable char builds

NOTES 24/05/22
	- multiple enemies dying has issues bc timers expire after array pos has already been freed

NOTES 01/06/22
	- (kinda) fixed enemies beeing freed at the same time bug
	- could no recreate bug again, which does not correct enemy to be freed at ailments.gd 32 (while loop does not trigger in some age cases for some reason)
	- counter at the end(?) of the game -> enemies killed, time passed, something to save to HD
	- wand proj calc is completely fucked after new enemies spawn in same lvl (boss portal)
