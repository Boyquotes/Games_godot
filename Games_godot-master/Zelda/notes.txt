if you don't know what to do -> just play the game and write down ideas + fix the bugs that you encounter


--IDEAS--

	!! main game problem solving idea -> balance build decisions and the damage types (resistances) of the biomes to be successful !!
	!! boss is very difficult and can only be defeated when chat is strong enough -> lvl has to repeated multiple times until enough equipment is found -> qual/quant goes up !!
	
	- archetypes have a drop chance from bosses -> drop chance goes higher when level reset (and enemies get a lot stronger) -> archetypes are biome specific
	- level reset drops as item that can be used (like a key that can be used to farm in the biome you need for the build)
		- make items wildly different depending on the item
	- make special mods appear on items	
	- interesting loot that changes gameplay -> special attacks
		- ideas: titanforged items, items with special modifiers
	- more item types -> boots, gloves, rings, helmets (to make it possible to stack resistances)
	- procedural levels to enable more interesting layouts -> gameplay implications?
	- class archetypes in form of items -> wizard robe, knight armor-> check sprite sheet
	- enable strategies to survive next level, boss fights -> stack res -> archetype -> weapon with damage type
	- code refactoring -> make a modular template for other games with the basics (scene changer, loot system, movement system)
	- balance lol
	- make the game loop make sense/fun to farm (lol) 
		- balance dmg against resist values
		- make farming items make sense
		- upgrades need to feel good (special mods depending on lvl -> torchlight)
	- refactor ailments.gd for bosses ||-||
	- damage numbers
	- procedural levels ? -- assignment 5 
	- special items drop from boss (higher ilvl?)
	- different fire modes (pwrups), more enemies spawned (testing)
	- visible armor
	- change boss reroll (rarity) depending on something (kills?)
	- make shop scene for ammo and/or other stuff
	- save game -> persistancy
	- item tooltip comparison

--CODE REFAC--	
	- KILL ALL GLOBAL FUNCTIONS
	- change scene func
 	- find a solution to cleanly transfer variables from scene to scene (load inventory+items and entities into singleton)
	- refactor the base functions -> create template

--NOTES--

08/10/22
	- quant/qual item removal calcs add_special_mod func

04/10/22
	- use boxes inside boxes and minimum height/width to correctly align boxes in GUI's

27/09/22
	- when multiple items in inventory -> wrong stat allocation
		- starter amor stats are added twice
	- items removed from inv (dropped to the floor) reappear in next scene -> items do not get removed from inv-items arr in drop_item()

24/09/22
	- better solution for transitioning items between scenes  -> current solution causes a lot of problems
		- attribute allocation after transition is fucked -> block_attribute_changes

17/09/22
	- resistance system that allows to stack resistances to be able to proceed to next level and be able to defeat the boss
	- mobs do the damage type of the biome so you have to prepare
		- make something else that makes it important to get specific gear

13/09/22
	- make life reg function the same as mana reg (or the other way around maybe)

10/09/22
	- item armor drops gets not assigned to item for some reason -> smth (which makes item = null) happens between func call of drop_armor and func call for adding mods
		- don't use variables with the same name (item is globally available as well as in the drop_armor func which is why the globals fund does not get updated)
		- better yet -> don't use global functions
	- drop tooltips get clipped by wall tiles ||BUG||

31/08/22
	- respawn var fucks up scene change func (gloves/boots id is the prob) ||-||
	- wrong body armor in slot after scene change ||-||

30/08/22
	- inventory_items behaves weirdly (error message if trying to print id in some cases) but somehow still works ||BUG||

17/08/22
	- stat attribution is a mess (str -> stren)

09/08/22
	- slime boss still jumps OOB ||BUG|| (put animation in one anim -> anim queuing fucks it somehow maybe)
	- bow boss behaves weirdly ||-||
	- lightning enemies take way too much dmg somehow ||-|| (balancing issue)
	- res goes over max into -value (fire res on dragon chest) ||-||

06/08/22
	- use local variables as parameters in functions instead of global variables
	- shop does currently not work due to refactoring of spawn_enemies()

03/08/22
	- bosses are not burning ||-||
		- include boss into enemy arrays?
	- pwrups do not get equipped automatically, if something has already been picked up ||BUG||

27/07/22
	- wand laser proj fucks up the enemy deletion (trying to free deleted objects) ||-||

26/07/22
	- damage types
		- physical -> starting, bleed (jungle)
		- fire	-> fire world
		- cold	-> snow world
		- lightning -> lightning world
		- poison -> desert world

	- attribute values are not transferred when coming back from store ||-||

23/07/22
	- procedural levels ? -- assignment 5 

19/07/22
	- bleed damage timer does not work on jungle enemies, bleed damage does not get assigned a value ||-||
	- portal direction does not work -> fix proj default dir ||-||

13/07/22
	- exp does not transfer between scenes from scenes to boss scene
	- enemies do not populate from boss to next scene

09/07/22
	- slime boss jumps OOB when colliding twice with level tiles ||BUG||
	- wand proj cannot target deleted object (enemy) BUG still exists

06/07/22
	- bow boss attack animation does not stop when the boss is walking again
	- multishot does not flip sprite when boss attacks when flipped_h

05/07/22
	- boss_bow proj are behaving weird bc of for in 99 loop -> need solution for the attack to start/stop depending on player coll with aggro range ||BUG||
	- different bow pattern depending on boss HP

14/06/22
	- boss loot? ||FEATURE||
	- scythe proj
	- boss dmg/bleed scaling
	- boss ability -> speed up and scythe attack


07/06/22
	- fire proj not working
	- hp bar not showing correctly
	- special arrows fire when wand proj is active
	- wand proj only fire at nearest enemy (bosses and portal not included) -> make arr with all entities


04/06/22
	- frog armor dex/speed bug
	- difference in enemy shown in game and actual enemy hp


01/06/22
	- (kinda) fixed enemies beeing freed at the same time bug
	- could no recreate bug again, which does not correct enemy to be freed at ailments.gd 32 (while loop does not trigger in some age cases for some reason)
	- counter at the end(?) of the game -> enemies killed, time passed, something to save to HD
	- wand proj calc is completely fucked after new enemies spawn in same lvl (boss portal)

body_set_shape_disabled: Can't change this state while flushing queries. Use call_deferred() or set_deferred() to change monitoring state instead.
  <C++ Error>   Condition "body->get_space() && flushing_queries" is true.

24/05/22
	- multiple enemies dying has issues bc timers expire after array pos has already been freed


21/05/22
	- encountered weird movement bug when pushed against the wall from snow enemies ||BUG||
	- enemy scaling seems weak
	- poison enemies are stronge
	- player modifiers after boss kill would enable char builds


18/05/22
	- dropped item remove timer cannot start multiple times which is why not all items are removed from the dropped_items array -> fixed
	- reformat coll/drop stuff

17/05/22
	- burn does not work on wand_proj ||-||
	- dropped items get removed even if they've been picked up


07/05.22
	- make lazor animations
	- lazor coll
	- lazor behaviour -> slowly dissapearing starting from player pos (anim?)

04/05/22
	- implement rest of wand proj's
	- next step should be enemy resistances to test the diff weapons on (what happens when weap is dmg type but uses ailments -> mode dam?)
	- implement some kind of monster spawner that can be triggered in every lvl
	- start implementing better architecture -> decoupling

27/04/22
	- dropped pwrups are not taken from the DB -> cannot be put in inv with current system -> make (wand) pwrups drop as items from a DB (?)
