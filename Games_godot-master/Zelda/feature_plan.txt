NOTES 27/04/22
	- dropped pwrups are not taken from the DB -> cannot be put in inv with current system -> make (wand) pwrups drop as items from a DB (?)

NOTES 04/05/22
	- implement rest of wand proj's
	- next step should be enemy resistances to test the diff weapons on (what happens when weap is dmg type but uses ailments -> mode dam?)
	- implement some kind of monster spawner that can be triggered in every lvl
	- start implementing better architecture -> decoupling
