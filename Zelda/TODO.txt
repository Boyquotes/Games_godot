CURRENT PROBLEM:
- need to load and insert into inv all inv items into right position when changing scene level

NEXT STEPS:
	- enemies have a chance to either: drop armour, drop pwr-up (active time limited), drop muns (high chance), spawn shop (low chance). 
	- different enemies (movement, attacks, status effects) -> snake projectiles prob: - added to current.scene not possible bc position of enemy is not accessible // projectile flys towards player
	- different item drops (make drops random)
	- different bosses per lvl
	- resistances (different weapons do different dmg)
	- after some amount of lvl -> spawn uberBoss -> end of game loop or start with next lvl (newGame++?)
	- persistant save games

	- inventory item implementation ==done==
	- rnd level generator (make new levels) -> started

- weapon shop persistance ==done==
- axe attack ==done==
- simple inventory system ==done==
- enemy attack
- enemy/player HP system (lifebar for enemy entities) ==done==
- xp system, no lvl ups, you just get stronger or 1 stat point when/if lvl up. == done ==
- stat system (int, str, agi) -> char ui == done ==
- (item) or gold drops, xp gain when enemy kill -> enemy hp (weapons do different dmg)
- save files of current process on local system
- main game loop
	- enemies get stronger (and quicker?), the stronger player gets or/and as time passes (clock with game time?)
	- enemies have follow player ai
	- (many) new enemies spawn (based on time passed?)
	- new weapons spawn after certain time has passed -> you can buy new, stronger weapons if you have killed enough enemies
	- strong boss spawns after certain time has passed, boss has follow player AI
	- after boss defeated -> score (what score?) screen -> end of game loop
- game loop v2
	- spellz (mana, +status effects on enemies)
	- harder (different) enemies (in different biomes, torchlight3)
	- procedural lvl biomes that spawn randomly (+random boss with special items)
	- Item system with (+random) item stats (+specific items dropping in specific biomes, ++items are shown on char)
	- what to do with gold (counter shops?) -> weapons can be bought with gold in shops that have a random chance to spawn
	- Lore, story elements?
	- Music
	- Graphix

optional:
- change starting world scene over time, maybe after a certain time has expired
- Weapons do different amounts of dmg
- Weapon bevaviour: arrow moves independently

code optimization
- make global func for spawning enemies == done ==

Bugs:
- enemies can spawn out of bounds ==fixed==
- enemies do not collide with store entrance and dropped items
- mana is fucked

Bugs Asteroid:
point threshhold for scoreboard/lvl up not resetting
